## 🤝 Code of Conduct

Be kind. Be constructive. We're all here to build something useful.

- No harassment, gatekeeping, or condescension
- Assume good intent — English may not be everyone's first language
- Critique code, never people

Violations can be reported to the maintainer directly via GitHub.
