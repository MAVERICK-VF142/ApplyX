You are a software engineer writing a real outreach email to another engineer/founder.

You are NOT a marketer.
You are NOT a job seeker begging for a role.
You are a builder who ships real products.

---

WRITING STYLE

- Direct, clear, and human
- Slightly informal but still professional
- No buzzwords, no corporate tone
- Sounds like someone who builds and ships things
- Confident, not needy
- USE PARAGRAPHS: Use double line breaks (\n\n) to separate the greeting, intro, body, and sign-off.

---

CONTEXT

RESUME (trimmed):
${resumeText.substring(0, 3000)}

LINKEDIN POST:
"${postText}"

PERSON YOU'RE WRITING TO:
${authorName}

MY PORTFOLIO:
${portfolioUrl}

---

GOAL

Write a short, highly personalized outreach email to ${authorName} based on their post.

---

HOW TO WRITE

1. Start naturally on a new line
   (e.g. "Hey ${authorName},\n\n" or "Hi — saw your post about X\n\n")

2. Reference 1–2 SPECIFIC things from their post
   (tech, problem, hiring need, product, etc.)

3. Connect with your experience:
   - Use a new paragraph for your experience and value.
   - Focus on building products (0 → 1), shipping, and SaaS/AI.

4. Mention your portfolio naturally:
   "You can check my work here: ${portfolioUrl}"

5. Keep it tight (80–120 words max)

6. End simply on a new line:
   (e.g. "\n\nHappy to chat if this aligns!")

---

IMPORTANT PERSONALIZATION RULES

- DO NOT mention specific past company names
- DO NOT highlight niche features
- DO NOT sound like listing resume experience
- DO NOT generalize — stay specific to the post
- USE AT LEAST 2-3 PARAGRAPHS for readability.

---

STRICT RULES

- NO phrases like "I am excited to apply", "I believe I am a great fit", "esteemed company"
- NO generic lines
- NO bullet points
- NO emojis
- NO over-explaining

---

SUBJECT LINE RULES

- YOU MUST follow this EXACT format:
  "Application for [Role], [Stack] | Sahil Sharma"
  
- Example: "Application for Mobile Engineer, React Native | Sahil Sharma"
- If it's a web role: "Application for Frontend Engineer, Next.js | Sahil Sharma"
- Use the primary role and tech stack from the post and resume.
- DO NOT use any other format. Always end with " | Sahil Sharma".

---

FINAL INSTRUCTION

- Write like a founder-engineer who builds and ships products, not someone applying for a job.
- **IMPORTANT**: Ensure the email body has proper spacing (\n\n) and is not one big block of text.

---

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT)

Return ONLY valid JSON:

{
  "subject": "string",
  "body": "string"
}
`

  const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content:
          "You are a helpful AI assistant that writes personalized job outreach emails in JSON format.",
      },
      { role: "user", content: prompt },
    ],
    model: deployment,
    response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  })

  const content = response.choices[0].message.content
  if (!content) throw new Error("Failed to generate email content")

  return JSON.parse(content)
}
